#MachineLearning
All that the machines can do for now is just learn, 
they just have to keep at it, no panic, no worries, no complaints. 
They are already dead. And the only way back to life is to learn to do something worthwile, 
something humans would do not and, do it just right. I feel like a machine right now.
