Develope complex projects that meet objectives in an efficient way:

Architecture Descriptions: 
  This is where the high-level structure of the software system is defined. It includes the identification of components, their relationships, and how they interact to fulfill the system’s requirements.
Needs, Requirements, Constraints: 
  At this stage, the specific needs of the stakeholders are gathered and translated into detailed requirements. Constraints such as performance, security, and cost are also identified to guide the design process.
Trade Studies: 
  This involves evaluating different architectural solutions against the requirements and constraints to determine the most suitable approach. It’s a decision-making process that considers various factors like cost, performance, and risk.
Verification and Validation: 
  Verification ensures that the software correctly implements a specific function according to its specifications. Validation checks that the software meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

Steps:
- Project Objectives
- Concept Formulation
- Decompose and Define
- Further Decomposition and Definition (Optional)
- Design and Build Modules/Parts
- Integrate
- Further Integration (Optional)
- Evaluation:
  - is this what we meant to build?
  - is this what the project wanted?

System Review Cycles: 
- Concept Review - System Requirements Review - System Design Review - Preliminary Design Review
