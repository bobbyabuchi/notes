# Algorithms

TOPIC: DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

- data types: stack, queue, bag, union-find, priority queue
- sorting: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort
- searching: BST, red-black BST, hash table
- graphs: BFS, DFS, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra
- strings: radix sorts, tries, KMP, regexps, data compression
- advanced: B-tree, suffix array, maxflow

Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. - Niklaus Wirth

## Steps to developing a usable algorithm

1. Model the problem.
2. Find an algorithm to solve it.
3. Fast enough? Fits in memory?
4. If not, figure out why.
5. Find a way to address the problem.
6. Iterate until satisfied.
