All that the machines can do for now is just learn, 
they just have to keep at it, no panic, no worries, no complaints. 
They are already dead. And the only way back to life is to learn to do something worthwile, 
something humans would do not and, do it just right. I feel like a machine right now.

#MachineLearning
Most of what the machines can do for now is just learn, and do what they are explicitly or implicitly required (not programmed) to do. 
They just have to stick to it, no panic, no worries, no complaints. 
They are already dead, and the only way to life is to learn well and deep enough, to beat our wildest imaginations as humans.
